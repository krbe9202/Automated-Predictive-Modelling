Task 2

Builds bi-variate drug response model, generates noise term from zero mean normal distribution with std=0.02. Simulates and visualize a 3D plot of an observed (noisy) drug response surface. Simulates one full experimental data set consisting of 512 datapoints corresponding to real wet lab experiments from literature. 

Task 3

An implementation of "Query-by-Committee" (QBC) based learning using kmeans clustering for initialization. Based on the drug response model used in Assigment 1. 

Task 4 

QBC based learning vs Random/Optimal designs. A comparison of the three strategies using their RMSE values based on simulated noisy datapoints selected uniformly.
